# vue-finder

> A Vue.js project

## Laundry list:
### Not in order to be created. 
1. Loading page.
2. User post page for all personal posts, and an edit, save, and cancel button and crud button. 
3. Graph for lost items found and not found
4. Add found/not found so people can mark items them found. 
5. Search bar and query to url? https://vuefinder-1.firebaseio.com/usersRef/-LOaHBe9kPebOGddgdX2/itemInformation/.json to create custom link, maybe use vue-router and pass as wildcard props or something? all the information can come from the route: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY2MiaYiSdw&ab_channel=LearnCode.academy in this video, he passes data directly from the URL, keep that in mind - me. This will work just need to pass key/post id in a strange way. 
**Security rules matter alot for this**
6. call back for loading https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire/blob/master/README.md
