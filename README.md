# vue-finder

> A Vue.js project

## Laundry list:
### Not in order to be created. 
1. Loading page.
2. ~~User post page for all personal posts, and an edit, save, and cancel button and crud button. ~~
3. Graph for lost items found and not found
4. ~~Add found/not found so people can mark items them found~~ **Style binding for them and hide them if they are found.** 
5. ~~Unique post url~~
**Security rules matter alot for this**
6. [call back for loading](https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire/blob/master/README.md)
7. Style
8. [Unit Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2QKTNmU-Tc) [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)

#Future Plans:
1.[ Offer the option to view the locations address rather than a pin](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse#try-it-yourself)
